## Projects Overview
### Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing textual data to determine the underlying sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). It is based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is a probabilistic classifier. The project involves preprocessing text data, extracting features, and applying Naive Bayes to classify sentiments. This project is useful for understanding customer feedback, reviews, and opinions.

### Twitter Sentiments
This project extends sentiment analysis to Twitter data, with a specific focus on handling challenges such as short text, slang, and hashtags. It includes scraping Twitter data, performing data cleaning and exploration, and applying a variety of deep learning algorithms. Additionally, it implements a feedforward neural network (FNN) to analyze sentiments.

### Spelling Checker
An NLP-based spelling checker designed to identify and correct spelling errors in text. It uses four basic operations—substitution, insertion, deletion, and transposition—to predict the correct spellings. This project also integrates language models to suggest corrections based on context. It is a valuable tool for improving text editing and writing quality.

### Fake News Detection
A machine learning-based project aimed at detecting fake news articles, with a dataset derived from Reddit's "The Onion" subreddit, which adds a layer of complexity and real-world context to the analysis.It involves feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or transformers to analyze the text content and classify news as either real or fake. This project is crucial in combating misinformation and ensuring the authenticity of news sources.
